<li>Opacity as Density blending feature for Terrain Lit Shader is now disabled when the Terrain has more than four Terrain Layers. This is now similar to the Height-blend feature for the Terrain Lit Shader.</li>
<li>DepthNormals passes now sample normal maps if used on the material, otherwise output the geometry normal.</li>
<li>SSAO Texture is now R8 instead of ARGB32 if supported by the platform.</li>
<li>Enabled subsurface scattering with GI on handwritten Universal ST8 shader.</li>
<li>Material upgrader now also upgrades AnimationClips in the project that have curves bound to renamed material properties.</li>
<li>2D Lights now inherit from Light2DBase.</li>
<li>The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to &quot;Dont Care&quot; has changed on mobile. Previously, &quot;Dont Care&quot; would behave identically to &quot;Solid Color&quot; on mobile. Now, &quot;Dont Care&quot; corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use &quot;Dont care&quot; only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.</li>
<li>Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.</li>
<li>When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.</li>
<li>URP Asset Inspector - Advanced settings have been reordered under <code>Show Additional Properties</code> on each section.</li>
<li>Changed the default name when a new urp asset is created.</li>
<li>URP Asset Inspector - <code>General</code> section has been renamed to <code>Rendering</code>.</li>
<li>Refactored some of the array resizing code around decal projector rendering to use new APIs in render core</li>
<li>UniversalRendererData and ForwardRendererData GUIDs have been reversed so that users coming from 2019LTS, 2020LTS and 2021.1 have a smooth upgrade path, you may encounter issues coming from 2021.2 Alpha/Beta versions and are recommended to start with a fresh library if initial upgrade fails.</li>

<h2 id="711---2019-09-05">[7.1.1] - 2019-09-05</h2>
<h3 id="upgrade-guide">Upgrade Guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>The render pipeline now handles custom renderers differently. You must now set up renderers for the Camera on the Render Pipeline Asset.</li>
<li>Render Pipeline Assets upgrades automatically and either creates a default forward renderer in your project or links the existing custom one that you've assigned.</li>
<li>If you have custom renderers assigned to Cameras, you must now add them to the current Render Pipeline Asset. Then you can select which renderer to use on the Camera.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="added-18">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added shader function <code>GetMainLightShadowParams</code>. This returns a half4 for the main light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.</li>
<li>Added shader function <code>GetAdditionalLightShadowParams</code>. This returns a half4 for an additional light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.</li>
<li>Added a <code>Debug Level</code> option to the Render Pipeline Asset. With this, you can control the amount of debug information generated by the render pipeline.</li>
<li>Added ability to set the <code>ScriptableRenderer</code> that the Camera renders with via C# using <code>UniversalAdditionalCameraData.SetRenderer(int index)</code>. This maps to the <strong>Renderer List</strong> on the Render Pipeline Asset.</li>
<li>Added shadow support for the 2D Renderer.</li>
<li>Added ShadowCaster2D, and CompositeShadowCaster2D components.</li>
<li>Added shadow intensity and shadow volume intensity properties to Light2D.</li>
<li>Added new Gizmos for Lights.</li>
<li>Added CinemachineUniversalPixelPerfect, a Cinemachine Virtual Camera Extension that solves some compatibility issues between Cinemachine and Pixel Perfect Camera.</li>
<li>Added an option that disables the depth/stencil buffer for the 2D Renderer.</li>
<li>Added manipulation handles for the inner cone angle for spot lights.</li>
<li>Added documentation for the built-in post-processing solution and Volumes framework (and removed incorrect mention of the PPv2 package).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-25">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased visible lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 256 visible lights except in mobile platforms. Mobile platforms support 32 visible lights.</li>
<li>Increased per-object lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 8 per-object lights in all platforms except GLES2. GLES2 supports 4 per-object lights.</li>
