<h1 id="changelog">Changelog</h1>

<p>All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.</p>
<p>The format is based on <a href="http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a Changelog</a>
and this project adheres to <a href="http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<h2 id="274---2025-10-06">[2.7.4] - 2025-10-06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where having an empty custom load or build path in the inspector would spam the console.</li>
<li>Fixed a faulty Inspector refresh mechanism when creating new addressables group from a template.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="273---2025-09-15">[2.7.3] - 2025-09-15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed Label window to have consistent Rename UX with the rest of the Editor. You can now press Enter (macOS) or F2 to enter rename, as well as clicking after selecting an item in the list.</li>
<li>Added documentation to mention the fact that loading AssetBundles directly via LoadAssetAsync does not handle dependencies.</li>
<li>Added null checks for analytics events to fix console error.</li>
<li>Fixed loading incorrect data when using dynamic internal id naming.</li>
<li>Documentation: Content model update.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where trying to build after setting a custom profile value would sometimes cause a NullRefException.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="272---2025-08-11">[2.7.2] - 2025-08-11</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where builds were failing in Unity Cloud Build due to hash collisions in Addressables during dependency resolution.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where remote binary catalogs would mistakenly be listed as having the .json file extension in the Build Report summary tab.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="270---2025-07-30">[2.7.0] - 2025-07-30</h2>

<li>Fixed an issue where you weren't able to assign Sprites in a AssetReferenceAtlasedSprite if the Atlas was a variant.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when &quot;Use Defaults&quot; was selected for a Group. When building for Android the local settings were used for remote groups. This effectively disabled caching.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Profiler runtime data was not stripped for non-development builds.</li>
<li>Improved memory usage when using binary catalogs.</li>
<li>Improved performance of the Addressable Groups editor window for large projects - this should be noticable when first launching the window, and when searching for assets.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Addressables Profiler Module would not work properly when using a standalone Profiler process.</li>
<li>Fix an issue where Custom group settings were not correctly applied to built-in bundles.</li>

<li>Added Preserve attribute to prevent stripping of RuntimePath property</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="260---2025-06-03">[2.6.0] - 2025-06-03</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where call to LoadAssetsAsync was treating single element keys into an array of characters.</li>
<li>Fixed binary catalog extraction &amp; optimization tools.  InternalIds of locations were getting resolved with Editor data incorrectly.  They are now copied directly to the output files.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="2316---2025-01-08">[2.3.16] - 2025-01-08</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="237---2024-12-04">[2.3.7] - 2024-12-04</h2>
<ul>
<li>The group edit window saves sort order and enabled columns. Groups are not sorted but can be reordered by dragging and dropping and that state is saved. This ordering has been moved to the Addressables data folder into the file AddressableAssetGroupSortSettings. This file can be added to .gitignore for per user sorting, or can be checked into version control for team sorting.</li>
<li>Fix &quot;IndexOutOfRangeException&quot; console message when assigning an addressable SpriteAtlas to an AssetReferenceSprite.</li>
<li>Make SubObjectGUID an Editor only field. It would not work properly at Runtime due to the lack of AssetDatabase, but this makes it explicit at compile time.</li>
<li>Switch the Runtime key to never use the SubObjectGUID and always use SubObjectName for subobjects.</li>
<li>CheckCatalogUpdate now returns 1 when there is an update available.</li>
<li>CanBuildPlayer has been switched to using the Bee postprocessor and should return better error messages on failure.</li>

<li>Fixed issue with asset hash calcluation for internal asset bundle name when building bundles.</li>
<li>Adding option &quot;Unique Bundle IDs&quot; to the General section of the AddressableAssetSettings Inspector.
<ul>
<li>If set, every content build (original or update) will result in asset bundles with more complex internal names.  This may result in more bundles being rebuilt, but safer mid-run updates.  See docs for more info.</li>
<li>This complex internal naming was added to 1.3.3 to support safter Content Catalog updating, but was forced on.  It is now optional as there are some drawbacks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Further improvement to the % complete calculations.
<ul>
<li>Note that this is an average of dependency operations. Meaning a LoadAssetsAsync call will average the download, and the loading progress.  DownloadDependenciesAsync currently has one extra op, so the download will crawl to 50%, then jump to done (we will look into removing that). Similarly any op that is called before Addressables init's will jump to 50% once init is done.</li>

<li>Fixed scenario where AsyncOperation Task fails to complete when AsyncOperation has already completed.</li>
<li>Fixed a missed init-log that was stuck always-logging.</li>
<li>Fixed issue around assets losing dependencies when unloaded then reloaded.  This would manifest most often as sprites losing their texture or prefabs losing their shader/material/texture.</li>
<li>Changed checks for determining if a path is remote or not from looking for &quot;://&quot; to looking for starting with &quot;http&quot;.  &quot;://&quot; is still used to determine if the asset should be loaded via UnityWebRequest or not.</li>
<li>Added Analyze Rule to show entire Asset Bundle layout</li>

<li>Made BuiltIn Data group read-only by default.</li>
<li>Fixed NullRef caused by an invalid (BuildIn Data) group being default during a build.</li>
<li>Fixed path where LoadResourceLocationsAsync could still throw an exception with unknown key.  Now it should not, and is a safe way to check for valid keys.

<li>If Key does not exist but nothing else goes wrong, it will return an empty list and Success state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed NullRef caused when there was a deleted scene in the scenes list.</li>
<li>BuildCompression for Addressables can now be driven from the default group.  If necessary WebGL builds will fallback to LZ4Runtime and all other build targets will fallback to LZMA.</li>
<li>Added options for bundle naming: AppendHash, NoHash, OnlyHash.
<ul>
<li>As a temporary workaround for updating issues, we recommend setting all groups with StaticContent=true to be NoHash.  This will make sure the updated catalog still refers to the correct unchanged bundle.  An actual fix will be out in a few releases.</li>

It will no longer destroy unknown instances.</li>

<li>Added ResourceType to IResourceLocation.
<ul>
<li>This allows you to know the type of a location before loading it.</li>
<li>Fixes a problem where calling Load*<type>(key) would load all items that matched the key, then filter based on type.  Now it will do the filter before loading (after looking up location matches)</type></li>

<h2 id="053-preview---2018-12-19">[0.5.3-preview] - 2018-12-19</h2>
<ul>
<li>fixed upgrade bug from 0.4.x or lower to 0.5.x or higher. During upgrade, the &quot;Packed Mode&quot; option was removed from play mode.  Now it's back and upgrades are safe from 0.4.x or from 0.5.x to 0.5.3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="052-preview---2018-12-14">[0.5.2-preview] - 2018-12-14</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>IMPORTANT CHANGE TO BUILDING</em>
<ul>
<li>We have disabled automatic asset bundle building.  That used to happen when you built the player, or entered play mode in &quot;packed mode&quot;.  This is no longer the case.  You must now select &quot;Build-&gt;Build Player Content&quot; from the Addressables window, or call AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent().  We did this because we determined that automatic building did not scale well at all for large projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fixed regression loading local bundles</li>
<li>Added Addressables.DownloadDependencies() interface</li>
<li>fixes for Nintendo Switch support</li>
<li>Fixed issues around referencing Addressables during an Awake() call</li>
<li>Code refactor and naming convention fixes</li>
<li>Cleaned up missing docs</li>
<li>Content update now handles not having and groups marked as Static Content</li>
<li>Fixed errors when browing for the addressables_content_state.bin and cancelling</li>
<li>Moved addressables_content_state.bin to be generated into the addressables settings folder</li>
<li>Changed some exceptions when releasing null bundles to warnings to handle the case of releasing a failed download operation</li>
<li>Separated hash and crc options to allow them to be used independently in asset bundle loads.</li>
<li>Use CRC in AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync calls if specified</li>
<li>Always include AssetBundleRequestOptions for asset bundle locations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="048-preview---2018-10-22">[0.4.8-preview] - 2018-10-22</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added all referenced types in asset bundles to link.xml to prevent them from being stripped in IL2CPP builds</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="047-preview---2018-10-20">[0.4.7-preview] - 2018-10-20</h2>
<ul>
<li>updated Scriptable Build Pipeline version in dependencies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="046-preview---2018-10-16">[0.4.6-preview] - 2018-10-16</h2>
<ul>
<li>MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VERSION - 2018.2.11+
<ul>
<li>We have re-enabled the addressables checkbox. Versions of 2018.2 older than the .11 release will work unless you attempt to view the Animation Import Settings inspector.  If you do have animations you need to inspect, use .11+. If you do not, use any official release version of 2018.2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refactored the way IResourceProviders are initialized in the player - serialized data is constructed at runtime to control how the providers are configured</li>
<li>added readonly custom inspector for AddressableAssetEntryCollection</li>
<li>AssetReference now stores the loaded asset which can be accessed via the Asset property after LoadAsset completes.  ReleaseAsset has been modified to not need the asset passed in (the old version is marked obsolete]</li>
<li>fixed profiler details view not updating when a mouse drag is completed</li>
<li>fixed null-ref when moving Resources to Addressables when there are no Resources</li>
<li>blocked moving EditorSceneList within GUI</li>
<li>fixed cap on address name length</li>
<li>fixed workflows of marking Resources as addressable and moving an addressable into Resources.</li>
<li>fixed issue where AssetReferenceDrawer did not mark scene as dirty when changed.</li>
<li>added Hosting Services feature; provides extensible framework and implementation for serving packed content to player builds from the Editor</li>
<li>replaced addressables buildscript with an interface based system.  IDataBuilder class is now used to define builders of specific types of data.  The Addressables settings object
contains a collection of data builders and uses these to create player and play mode data.  Users can implemented custom data builders to control the build process.</li>
<li>replaced AssetGroupProcessors with a collection of AssetGroupSchema objects.  The difference is that the schema objects only contain data and groups can have multiple schemas.  The
logic for processing groups now resides in the build script and uses the schemas as data sources and filters for how to build.</li>
<li>Added Initialization objects that can be created during the build to run during addressables initialization</li>
<li>Implemented Caching API initialization with initialization objects</li>
<li>Changed some API and tests to work with 2019.x</li>
<li>fixed how AssetReference's draw when within lists, arrays, or contained classes</li>
<li>Fixed the workflow of scenes moving in and out of the Editor Build Settings Scene list.</li>
<li>Removed &quot;Preview&quot; and added &quot;Analyze&quot;.
<ul>
<li>The new system runs any rules it knows about.</li>
<li>Currently this is one rule that is manually set up in code. Future work will have additional rules, and expose the ability to create/add user- or project-specific rules</li>
<li>This process can be slow, as it runs most of a build to get accurate data.</li>
<li>Within the Analyze window there is a &quot;fix&quot; button that allows each rule to fix any issues if the rule knows how.</li>
<li>The current rule is a &quot;check duplicate asset&quot; rule. This looks for assets that are pulled into multiple asset bundles due to dependency calculations. The way it fixes things is to move all of those into a newly created group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added option to toggle logging of all exceptions within the Resource Manager</li>
<li>Refactored initialization of the addressable asset settings to prevent it getting into a bad state.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="035-preview---2018-09-05">[0.3.5-preview] - 2018-09-05</h2>
<ul>
<li>implemented content update workflow.  Added a dropdown to the &quot;Build&quot; button on main window's toolbar.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Build/Prepare for Content Update&quot; will detect assets in locked bundles (bundles flagged as static, by default all local bundles).</li>
<li>&quot;Build/Build for Content Update&quot; will build assets with a catalog that is compatible with a previously released player.</li>
<li>&quot;Build/Build Packed Data&quot; will build in the same way entering play mode in PackedMode would.</li>
<li>implemented Clean Build. &quot;Build/Clean/*&quot; will clear out build caches.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>default the first 2 converted groups to have StaticContent set to true</li>
<li>UI Redesign</li>
<li>Moved most data settings onto actual assets.  AddressableAssetSettings and AddressableAssetGroup assets.
<ul>
<li>AddressableAssetSettings asset has &quot;Send Profile Events&quot;, list of groups, labels, and profiles</li>
<li>AddressableAssetGroup assets have all data associated with that group (such as BuildPath)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made &quot;preview&quot; be a sub-section within the Addressables window.</li>
<li>The &quot;Default&quot; group can now be set with a right-click in the Addressables window.</li>
<li>Set play mode from &quot;Mode&quot; dropdown on main window's toolbar.</li>
<li>Moved &quot;Hierarchical Search&quot; option onto magnifying glass of search bar.  Removed now empty settings cog button.</li>
<li>fixed issue when packing groups into seperate bundles generated duplicate asset bundle names, leading to an error being thrown during build</li>
<li>added support for disabling the automatic initialization of the addressables system at runtime via a script define:  ADDRESSABLES_DISABLE_AUTO_INITIALIZATION</li>
<li>added API to create AssetReference from AddressableAssetSettings object in order to create an entry if it does not exist.</li>
<li>moving resource profiler from the ResourceManager package to the Addressables package</li>
<li>fixed bug where UnloadScene operation never entered Done state or called callback.</li>
<li>fixed loading of additonal catalogs. The API has changed to Addressables.LoadCatalogsFromRuntimeData.</li>
<li>fixed bug in InitializationOperation where content catalogs were not found.</li>
<li>changed content update workflow to browse for cachedata.bin file instead of folder</li>
<li>fixed exception thrown when creating a group and using .NET 4.x</li>
<li>fixed bugs surrounding a project without addressables data.</li>
<li>AssetLabelReference inspector rendering</li>
<li>AssetReference drag and drop</li>

<li>fixes surrounding the stability of interacting with the &quot;default&quot; group.</li>
<li>Added docs for the Content Update flow.</li>
<li>Adjusted UI slightly so single-clicking groups shows their inspector.</li>
<li>removed not-helpful &quot;Build/Build Packed Data&quot; item from menu.</li>
<li>fixed bug where you could no longer create groups, and group assets were not named correctly</li>
